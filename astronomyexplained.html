<p class="paragraphe">Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and the phenomena that occur in the cosmos.
     It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and their overall evolution.
      Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, meteoroids, asteroids, and comets.
    Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and 
     cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates
    beyond Earth's atmosphere. Cosmology is a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.


    <p class="paragraphe">Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made 
    methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks, Indians,
     Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included 
     disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of 
     calendars.

     <p class="paragraphe">Professional astronomy is split into observational and theoretical branches. 
        Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects.
         This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented 
         toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and
          phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain
           observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.

           <p class="paragraphe">Astronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role.
             This is especially true for the discovery and observation of transient events. Amateur
              astronomers have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.
