<h2 class="header">Protostar

<p class="paragraph">protostar is the earliest compact form of a star. It is an accumulation of gas that has
been collapsed and compressed down from a huge dust-gas cloud. This early phase of a star has a 
time period of about 100,000 years. As time passes, pressure and gravity rise, which pushes the
baby star to collapse into a denser form. Almost all the energy emitted by the protostar arises from 
the heat generated from the gravitational force. In this state, there is enough energy to start
the nuclear reactions.

<h2 class="header">Red Dwarf

<p class="paragraph">A red dwarf star is the coolest and smallest type of star in the main-sequence phase. 
    They are the most common class of stars in the Milky Way. As per the latest estimation, they make
    up 75% of the stars in our galaxy. Even though they are very common, they are not easily detectable
    due to their relatively low luminosity. Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf, just like the majority of
    our nearest stars. They are much cooler and dimmer than the Sun. Even though they are exhausted 
    from a lack of adequate fuel, they are still able to squeeze available hydrogen into their core.

    <h2 class="header">White Dwarf
    
    <p class="paragraph">When a star loses its entire reserve of hydrogen fuel in the core and lacks enough
        mass to push heavier elements into a nuclear fusion reaction, it transforms into a white dwarf star.
        The outward push from the fusion reaction stops, and the stellar core collapses inward due to its
        own overwhelming gravitational pull. As it is hot enough to emit light, it shines to a mediocre 
        extent. On the other hand, there is no nuclear fusion happening inside the core. It will continue 
        to lose its heat and energy until it reaches the Universe’s background temperature. This phenomenon
        takes about hundreds of billions of years to complete.

        <h2 class="header">Neutron Star
        
        <p class="paragraph">Stars with a mass between 1.35 and 2.1 times that of the Sun don’t transform into
            white dwarfs when their core collapses. In this scenario, stars do not disintegrate into a
            supernova explosion; instead, they become extremely dense celestial bodies called neutron stars.
            stellar core collapses into a much denser form with extremely high gravitational pull.
            As the name suggests, they are entirely made of neutrons. Gravitational force is so strong
            that the matter collapses to the level of a neutron. Gravity crushes protons and electrons 
            together to form neutrons. If stars are much more massive, then the stars explode as 
            supernovas and ultimately turn into black holes.
