    <h2 class="headera"> Yuri Gargarin
        <p class="paragrapha">In 1955, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was chosen by the Soviets for mankind’s 
            first trip to space due to his impressive record as a fighter pilot in the military. Six years 
            later, Gagarin would take a flight 203 miles above the earth, making him the first person to go
             into space. </p>

     <p class="paragrapha">His first words, the first ever spoken by a human in space, were, “I see the earth.
         It’s so beautiful!”</p>

     <div class="astronaut2">
        <h2 class="headera"> Neil Armstrong
            <p class="paragrapha">Neil Armstrong is arguably the most famous astronaut that ever lived. 
                The Ohio-born astronaut became famous the world over in 1969 when he became the first man 
                to walk on the moon. His iconic words, “that’s one small step for man, one giant leap for 
                mankind,” are some of the most famous in history.  </p>
    
         <p class="paragrapha">The astronaut led a relatively quiet life after returning to earth, 
            spending the rest of his career teaching and working for aviation companies. He died in 2012.</p>

         <div class="astronaut3">
            <h2 class="headera"> Alan Shepard
                <p class="paragrapha">Born in 1923, Nasa Astronaut Alan Shepard was the first American in 
                    space. After WWII, Alan Shepard went back to school and became a test pilot. He is famous
                     for being one of only 12 individuals who also walked on the moon. Alan Shepard was 
                     involved in 2 space missions, and famously was the first person to hit a golf ball
                      on the moon.  </p>

             <div class="astronaut4">
                <h2 class="headera"> John Glenn
                    <p class="paragrapha">John Glenn was one of the most American astronaut heroes. 
                     In 1962, he became the first American to orbit the earth — he travelled around the
                     world three times in five hours aboard the Friendship 7 spacecraft.   </p>
                <p class="paragrapha">It was far from his foray into the exciting world of altitude travel.
                     Five years before he became the first American to orbit the earth, Glenn became the first
                      person to travel across the American continent at supersonic speeds. During that trip,
                       a start of the art attached to the aircraft captured the first panoramic image of the
                        United States. His success prompted NASA to draft him as part of ‘Mercury Seven,’ 
                        which was the first gathering of astronauts in the country.</p>

    <div class="astronaut5">
        <h2 class="headera"> Sally Ride
            <p class="paragrapha">Her trip to space got underway on June 18th, 1983, as part of the STS-
                 mission on the Challenger along with five other astronauts. Her second space trip occurred
                  a year later, also aboard the Challenger.</p>
        <p class="paragrapha">The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster put all space trips on hold, and Ride
             wasn’t able to go on any further mission. She retired from NASA in 1987 and worked as a physics
              professor and a vocal advocate for Stem education. Ride would stay in the public eye, however,
               as a key part of both the 1986 and 2003 investigations into the Challenger disaster. </p>
